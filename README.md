#LadderUp
Overview
The Career Recommender Chatbot is an interactive web application designed to help students choose their ideal career paths based on their strengths and interests. Built with Streamlit, it leverages machine learning techniques and text analysis (TF-IDF and cosine similarity) to match user responses with the most suitable career options.

Features

Personalized Career Suggestions: Recommends careers aligned with user strengths and interests.

Intuitive Chat Interface: Interaction via a simple chat box powered by Streamlit.

Background Customization: Visual themes and logo integration to enhance user experience.

Efficient Data Processing: Uses Pandas for data handling and TF-IDF for text vectorization.

How It Works

User Input: Students interact with the chatbot, submitting details about their interests and strengths through the chat interface.

Text Vectorization: The chatbot uses TF-IDF vectorization to numerically represent user input and dataset entries.

Similarity Matching: Cosine similarity calculates how closely user profiles match various career paths.

Result Display: The chatbot recommends careers with the highest similarity scores, presenting tailored options to the user.

Visual Presentation: Custom backgrounds and logo are loaded for a professional interface.

Code Highlights

Uses the following libraries: streamlit, csv, os, pandas, base64, sklearn.feature_extraction.text, sklearn.metrics.pairwise.

Key functions:
set_background_local: Sets custom background images for the app.
get_base64_image: Processes and renders the logo.

Utilizes data files for career information and imagery (ensure files like ladderup background.png, ladderup.png are present in the working directory).
